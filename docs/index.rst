Welcome to learnergy4video's documentation!
=======================================

Did you ever reach a bottleneck in your computational experiments? Are you tired of implementing your own techniques? If yes, learnergy4video is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of energy-based machine learning algorithms. From datasets to fully-customizable models, from internal functions to external communication, we will foster all research related to energy-based machine learning.

Use learnergy4video if you need a library or wish to:

* Create your energy-based machine learning algorithm;
* Design or use pre-loaded learners;
* Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem;
* Because it is incredible to learn things.

learnergy4video is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**.
